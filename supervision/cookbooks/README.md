# Supervision Cookbooks

## About

The Roboflow Cookbook is an open-source collection of examples and guides for building with the [Roboflow Ecosystem](https://roboflow.com/).

Cookbooks are meant to be common and small scoped computer vision tasks that can allow a user to quickly hit the ground running. Learning is the main goal and purpose.

Some examples require a Roboflow API key. You can [create a free account here](https://app.roboflow.com/login).
